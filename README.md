# Parallel Computing
- [I am inevitable](https://kausthubtm.medium.com/i-am-inevitable-8e80d29b18dc) : This blog is about the article "The free lunch is over" by Herb Sutter where he  stresses the importance of concurrent and parallel computing. This reminds us that the speed up due to hardware improvements are declining and warns us that parallel computing is going to be inevitable if we want to improve the speed up and can no longer be dependent on the hardware enhancements.

# Compilers
- [Journey of the “Hello world” program](https://kausthubtm.medium.com/journey-of-the-hello-world-program-ba8975a15a4c) : During my first year i always wondered what would happen to the a program when I type the commands "gcc name.c" and "./a.out". This blog briefly expalins the various processes that a program comes accross while compiling. 
 
- [Higher Order Calculator (hoc)](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/higher-order-calculator-hoc-7781df55283b) : Hoc is an interperter whose basic functionality is to evaluate floating-point numerical expressions, e.g., “1+2*sin(0.7)”. Initilally it was quite primitive but later variables were added, conditionals, loops, user-defined functions, simple IO, and more, using a syntax resembling C. There are six versions for hoc till now starting from hoc1 to hoc6 where enhancements and optimisations where made. Check out [this](https://github.com/kausthubtm/HOC) for different versions of HOC. The bog explains the first version of HOC.
